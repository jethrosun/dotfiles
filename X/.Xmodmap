! Modifier key remapping
! We want to rewire caps lock and control keys
clear      lock
clear   control
keycode      37 = Control_L
! Caps -> Control_L
keycode      66 = Control_L
! Control_R stays
keycode     105 = Multi_key
! We apparently need to say that these are control keys?
add     control = Control_L Control_R
! AltGr is Mode_switch
keycode     108 = Mode_switch

! Exchange left Alt and left Win
keycode 133 = Alt_L
keycode 64 = Super_L
remove Mod1 = Alt_L
remove Mod4 = Super_L
add Mod1 = Super_L
add Mod4 = Alt_L
