* insights on rally from openstack team

"CinderVolumes.create_and_delete_volume" can be good as well for statistic. 
First of all, it operates simple actions(not simple, but more stable). And 
another big advantage - it removes the volume in each iteration, so you can 
exucute this scenario with a bit number of total iterations without usage of 
all resources of your cloud
bigger number of iterations -> smoother timings

@shwsun hi! To be honest, VM at random hardware is used for our CI + all 
openstack projects are used from master branches, which means a lot of random 
factors. if you test openstack at real hardware with fixed version, the results 
will be more stable
