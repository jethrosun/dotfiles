## Reasons these files are here

I decide to write some blogs, one purpose is for my technical
communication skills -- my advisor has complained about it for a long
time and I finally decide to do something about it. Another reason is
that I constantly find myself disappointed about various things while
working on sth. Take the first blog I am about to write as an example:
I am so disappointed that even in 2017 there is still not a clean way to
install some beautiful fonts in Linux (Yeah Linux and LaTeX!)

In order to change this or ease my pain, I decide to write about how to
install some good fonts or just the way I find decent to finish the job.
